    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>Pizza is an iconic and versatile dish that originated in Italy, specifically in Naples. It consists of a round, flat dough base, typically made from wheat flour, water, yeast, and salt. The dough is rolled out into a circular shape and then topped with various ingredients. The most traditional pizza is the Margherita, which features a simple topping of tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella cheese, basil leaves, and a drizzle of olive oil. The combination of the tangy sauce, creamy cheese, and fresh herbs makes this pizza a timeless classic.

        Over time, pizza has evolved into a global favorite, and there are now endless variations. Some popular toppings include meats like pepperoni, sausage, or ham, vegetables like mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, and olives, and even unique ingredients such as pineapple or anchovies. The pizza crust can also vary in thickness, ranging from thin and crispy to thick and doughy, depending on regional preferences.
        
        Once assembled, the pizza is baked in a hot oven, often at temperatures ranging from 475°F to 800°F (245°C to 425°C). The intense heat causes the cheese to melt and bubble, and the crust becomes golden and slightly charred around the edges. Some people prefer a wood-fired oven, which imparts a smoky flavor and creates a distinctive texture.
        
        Pizza is widely enjoyed for its flavor, convenience, and adaptability. It can be served as a casual snack, a quick meal, or even as a gourmet experience with high-quality ingredients. Whether eaten at a pizzeria, ordered for delivery, or made from scratch at home, pizza remains one of the most beloved comfort foods around the world, uniting diverse cultures with its delicious, shareable nature.</p>
    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>16 ounces pizza dough, store-bought or homemade </li>
        <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce (see below)</li>
        <li>18 to 20 slices pepperoni</li>
        <li>12 ounces mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fresh oregano, optional</li>
        <li>Flour for rolling and shaping dough</li>
        <p><strong>For The Quick Pizza Sauce</strong></p>
        <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce (no salt)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated onion</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500°F:
            If you are using a pizza stone, preheat it in the oven for at least 20 minutes so it is nice and hot as well.</li>
        <li>Make the sauce:
            If you are using my sauce recipe, stir together the ingredients. The sauce recipe makes just enough for one large pizza. You can easily double it if you are making more than one pizza.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough:
            Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface. If it's hard to roll, let it rest for 5 minutes so it can come to room temperature. For a large pizza, I like to roll my dough into about a 14-inch diameter circle.</li>
        <li>Add the toppings:
            Transfer the dough to a lightly dusted pizza peel. Alternatively, fit it into a large cast-iron.
            
            Add sauce in a light layer all over the pizza, leaving about 1/4-inch crust around the edges. Chop half of the pepperoni and sprinkle it over the sauce. Top the pizza with grated cheese and the rest of the pepperoni. Season with black pepper.</li>
        <li>
            Cook the pizza:
If you're using a pizza stone, carefully slide pizza into the center of the preheated pizza stone. Cook for 6 minutes, then rotate the pizza halfway so it cooks evenly. Cook for another 6 to 8 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and charred in spots.

If you're using a skillet, press the dough into a cast iron skillet and add toppings. Place the skillet over a high heat burner for 2 minutes to get it preheated and get the crust cooking right away. Then transfer to a 500 °F oven and bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>Slice and serve:
            Use pizza peel to slide pizza out onto a cutting board. Let the pizza rest for a minute and slice into pieces. Season with fresh oregano (optional). Serve while warm with a side salad.</li>
