    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>Chicken biryani is a richly flavorful and aromatic dish that holds a special place in the culinary traditions of South Asia, particularly in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. It is a one-pot meal made by layering tender, marinated chicken with perfectly cooked basmati rice, creating a harmonious blend of spices and textures. The chicken is typically marinated in a mixture of yogurt, garlic, ginger, turmeric, red chili powder, garam masala, and other aromatic spices, which not only tenderize the meat but also infuse it with deep, complex flavors. The rice, often soaked beforehand, is cooked with spices like cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, and bay leaves, which add a fragrant and slightly earthy aroma. Saffron or turmeric is sometimes added to the rice to impart a golden color and subtle, exotic flavor.

        The cooking process of chicken biryani involves layering partially cooked rice and marinated chicken, then slow-cooking everything together, allowing the flavors to meld as the steam infuses the rice with the savory chicken juices. The slow-cooking method ensures that each grain of rice absorbs the spices and the chicken becomes tender and succulent. Onions, fried to a crispy golden brown, are often sprinkled on top for added sweetness and texture, and raisins or boiled eggs can also be added for additional richness.
        
        Biryani is a celebratory dish, often made for special occasions like weddings, festivals, and family gatherings, but it is also enjoyed as a comforting meal at home. It is typically served with sides such as cooling raita (a yogurt-based sauce with herbs and spices), a fresh salad, or a tangy pickle, which complement the rich and spiced nature of the dish. The combination of tender chicken, fragrant rice, and the intricate layering of spices makes chicken biryani a beloved dish worldwide, known for its bold flavors, beautiful presentation, and satisfying, hearty nature. Whether prepared in a traditional dum style (slow-cooked in a sealed pot) or using a quicker method, chicken biryani remains a timeless favorite, delighting food lovers with each aromatic bite.</p>

        <li>2 large onions, thinly sliced</li>

        <li>Fresh cilantro and mint leaves for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the Chicken:
            In a large bowl, combine the chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger garlic paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala, ground coriander, cumin powder, salt, lemon juice, chopped cilantro, and mint leaves.
            Mix the chicken thoroughly to ensure it's well-coated with the marinade. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight for best results.
            </li>
        <li>Prepare the Rice:
            Wash the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear, then soak it for 30 minutes.
            In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add the bay leaves, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon stick, and a pinch of salt.
            Add the soaked rice to the boiling water and cook for about 5-7 minutes, until the rice is 70% cooked (the grains should still be firm). Drain the rice and set it aside.</li>
        <li>Cook the Chicken:
            In a large pan, heat 2 tablespoons of ghee or oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and fry them until they turn golden brown and crispy. Remove half of the onions and set them aside for garnishing later.
            Add the marinated chicken pieces to the pan with the remaining onions and cook for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Let the chicken cook through and absorb the spices. Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until the tomatoes soften and release their juices.
            Sprinkle in ground turmeric and garam masala powder, and cook for another 5 minutes until the chicken is fully cooked and the mixture is thick.</li>
        <li>Layer the Biryani:
            If you have saffron, soak the saffron strands in 1/4 cup of warm milk for a few minutes.
            In a large pot or Dutch oven, layer the cooked chicken mixture at the bottom. Then layer the partially cooked rice on top of the chicken.
            Drizzle the saffron-infused milk over the rice (optional). You can also add a few more fresh mint and cilantro leaves for extra aroma and flavor.
            Cover the pot tightly with a lid or seal with dough to trap the steam, and cook on low heat for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.
            </li>
        <li>Serve:
            Once the biryani is cooked, gently fluff the rice and chicken with a fork to mix. Serve the chicken biryani hot, garnished with fried onions, fresh cilantro, and mint leaves.
            It's commonly served with cooling raita (yogurt with cucumber and spices) or a tangy pickle.</li>
