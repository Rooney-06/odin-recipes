    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>A burger is a beloved dish that has evolved into a global comfort food, known for its satisfying combination of flavors and textures. At its core, a burger consists of a ground meat patty, traditionally made from beef, although many variations exist, including those with chicken, turkey, fish, or even plant-based patties for vegetarians and vegans. The meat is typically seasoned with salt, pepper, and various spices before being grilled, pan-fried, or flame-broiled to perfection. The patty is usually nestled between a soft, toasted bun, which serves as the perfect vessel to hold all the delicious ingredients together.

        Classic burger toppings include crisp lettuce, juicy tomato slices, crunchy pickles, and thinly sliced onions, all of which add freshness and texture to the savory patty. A slice of melted cheese, such as cheddar, Swiss, or American, is often included to elevate the flavor and create a creamy, indulgent bite. Condiments like ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, or specialty sauces like barbecue or aioli provide an additional layer of flavor, complementing the richness of the meat.
        
        Beyond the basics, burgers can be customized to suit every taste. Additions like crispy bacon, avocado slices, sautéed mushrooms, fried eggs, or even fried onions can take the burger to new levels of deliciousness. Some gourmet burgers feature exotic ingredients like truffle oil, spicy jalapeños, or even lobster, transforming the classic comfort food into a fine dining experience.
        
        Burgers are often paired with sides like golden French fries, sweet potato fries, onion rings, or coleslaw, making for a well-rounded and satisfying meal. Whether enjoyed at a fast food joint, a casual diner, or a high-end restaurant, the burger remains a universally loved dish, celebrated for its versatility and ability to bring together a variety of flavors in a single, handheld meal.</p>
    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <p><strong>For the Burger Patties</strong></p>
        <li>1 lb (450g) ground beef (preferably 80% lean, 20% fat for juicy burgers)</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped (optional)</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, minced (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce (optional, for added flavor)</li>
        <li>1 tsp paprika or any seasoning you prefer (optional)</li>
        <p><strong>For Assembling the Burger</strong></p>
        <li>4 hamburger buns (brioche buns are a great choice)</li>
        <li>4 slices of cheese (American, cheddar, Swiss, or your favorite)</li>
        <li>Lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>Tomato slices</li>
        <li>Onion slices (raw or caramelized)</li>
        <li>Pickles (optional)</li>
        <li>Condiments like ketchup, mustard, mayo, or your favorite sauce</li>

    </ul>
    <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Patties:

            In a mixing bowl, combine the ground beef with the chopped onion, minced garlic, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and any optional seasonings like paprika. Mix gently until everything is well combined, but avoid overmixing as it can make the patties tough.
            Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and shape each into a patty that is about 3/4-inch thick. Use your thumb to create a small indentation in the center of each patty to prevent it from puffing up while cooking.
            </li>
        <li>Cook the Patties:

            Heat a grill, grill pan, or skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, place the patties on the grill or in the pan. Cook for about 4-5 minutes on the first side, then flip and cook for another 3-4 minutes, depending on how well done you like your burgers.
            In the last minute of cooking, place a slice of cheese on each patty and cover the pan or grill to melt the cheese.</li>
        <li>Toast the Buns:

            While the patties are cooking, cut the hamburger buns in half and toast them lightly on the grill or in a pan until golden brown. This adds a nice texture and prevents the buns from getting soggy when assembled.</li>
        <li>Assemble the Burgers:

            Place the bottom half of each bun on a plate. Top with a cooked burger patty with melted cheese, then add the lettuce, tomato slice, onion, and pickles if using. Drizzle with ketchup, mustard, mayo, or your favorite sauce.
            Place the top half of the bun on top to complete the burger.</li>
        <li>Serve:

            Serve your delicious homemade burgers with sides like French fries, onion rings, or a simple salad.</li>
